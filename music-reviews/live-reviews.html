    <h2>Steel Panther + Wayward Sons @ Victoria Warehouse, Manchester on February 9<sup>th</sup> 2020</h2>
    <p>If the joke isn’t funny anymore then nobody has told the five thousand people queuing in a storm to get into the venue. This is the night we were warned to stay in, batten down the hatches and hold our children close, yet a sold out crowd has ignored the prophets of doom and ventured out into the night. Even the Man Citeh game was cancelled due to Storm Ciara but Victoria Warehouse didn’t care that there was at least an hour long queue to get into the venue. Seriously if you’re going to frisk everyone and check the contents of their wallets then get more staff on the doors. Perhaps use the security who go around the vicinity bullying punters into paying £10 to park on public land would be a start.</p>
    <p>To say I was fewmin by the time I got in was an understatement, I ordered a pint and slowly thawed out.</p>
    <p>Tonight's audience is a bizarre mix of forty and fifty something glam survivors who are here to re-live the debauched eighties and twenty something's who view tonight to be on par with going to see Jack Whitehall or Jimmy Carr. The latter demographic really struggle with openers <a href="https://www.waywardsonsband.com/site/">Wayward Sons</a>. You see this is a proper rock n' roll band with a proper rock n' roll singer and the millennials in attendance (who weren’t still stuck in the queue outside) have come, pure and simple for comedy. While Toby and his mates ply their increasingly political heavy rock, you can clearly hear the hum of disengaged conversations from the disinterested. To give them their dues they do clap along when they are asked to, but they are here to laugh and not to sing along with upbeat funky rock. Despite the half-arsed interest of half the crowd, ( the other half still outside) Wayward Sons are excellent and show that no matter how old you are Rock N’ Roll dreams do come true. Toby is the perfect angry old man, using scuzzy riffs and pounding choruses to scream at the injustice of it all. This is certainly not their crowd, but they still manage to be memorable. Who knows maybe their crowd were the ones still trying to get in.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.steelpantherrocks.com">Steel Panther</a> shows have evolved from Rock gigs into something that more resembles the Rocky Horror Show. Loads of folks have made the effort and it is Wigs and cheap Lycra spandex from eBay all the way to the back. Everyone now knows the joke, but rather than become stale and unfunny we have owned it and now revel in it en-masse screaming the punch-lines back at the band. It is a bit like going to see Peter Kay and booming the lines of the “Garlic Bread” routine back at him. New Album “Heavy Metal Rules” seriously stinks and I suspect the band knows it as it gets a pitiful three songs for it. The crowd are here for the songs that they know and ‘Asian Hooker’, 'Party Like Tomorrow is the End of World ‘and 'Poontang Boomerang' all evoke gigantic communal sing-alongs that you would not want your grandmother to hear. </p>
    <p>The other thing about Steel Panther is that they are not a bunch of comedian’s pretending to be a band, they are actually a bunch of virtuoso musicians that have hit upon a money (shot) train that has turned them into unexpected superstars. The Guitar solo from Satchel is up there with anything George Lynch, Warren De Martini or Eddie Van Halen could throw out and Michael Starr’s vocals again blew me away with his range and power, at one point he sang a line in a rock operatic style and the guys standing behind commented how they could have listened to a full song as his voice was amazing. And as for Lexxi Fox’s’ outfit well don’t get me started on that! But at the end of the day Steel Panther is about mindless, filthy communal fun. There is audience participation all the way through with pink haired girls being serenaded at, fake stage invasions and the obligatory kid called upon to play guitar.  As a woman I’m not offended by any of it as I know it is all tongue in cheek and us bitches are all in on the joke.</p>
    <p>It may now be all very familiar, but this does not in anyway dent the enjoyment. It’s a joke we know and love and don’t tire of hearing. Silly, crude and juvenile but that is why we are here and God, do we lick it up.</p>

    <h2>The Wildhearts, Backyard Babies & CKY @ Kentish Town Forum, London on February 1<sup>st</sup> 2020 </h2>
    <p>Having somehow spent the last 30 years crossing paths with THE WILDHEARTS I finally found myself at last, in the same venue about to watch the classic line up in all their glory but before their arrival I had the added bonus of two cracking bands to get the momentum up and running. CKY and the BACKYARD BABIES were those chosen acts and everyone gathered knew this was going to be a very special evening. CKY rolled into town with just 2 band members ? guitarist / vocalist Chad I Ginsburg and Jess Margera on drums which were placed towards the front of the stage. To be fair I know very little about CKY but what a glorious noise they made, with their punky almost stoner rock leanings and you would not think it possible that they can replicate such a hard hitting sound.</p>
    <p>Opener “HI FI” sets the ball rolling and from my vantage point I could clearly see that the group were enjoying the interaction from the crowd. Another track that stood out was “FRENETIC” with the riff just cutting the air like a hot knife through butter. On the performance tonight CKY deserve to be rewarded with many more new fans (me included).</p>
    <p>With the venue filling up to bursting point downstairs it was obvious BACKYARD BABIES have many, many fans in London. With the familiar opening intro of “FRIGGIN IN THE RIGGIN” which always brings a big smile to my face. It’s head first into “GOOD MORNING MIDNIGHT” with Dregen swirling like a spinning top with his low slung guitar following close behind, Nicke Borg as ever is the complete package when it comes to front men working up the crowd and peeling off the riffs while putting in a high energy vocal display.</p>
    <p>White lights add to the effect while the group rip through “NOMADIC” and “HIGHLIGHTS” before everyone grabs a breather and out comes the acoustic guitar for a jaw dropping version of “PAINKILLER” followed closely by “ROADS” which display another side to the band and especially Nicke Borgs powerful vocals. Much like tonight’s headliners BACKYARD BABIES seem to throw every guitar based genre into their music from punk, to hyped up rocker billy with crushing rock riffs and lots of snippets of Chuck Berry making every song sound different from the previous song.</p>
    <p>Dregen announces that he wants to sing for us, so we get a blast through “STAR WAR” whilst the crowd feel duly obliged to join in with some singing of their own. Although on tonight’s performance everything was just spontaneous with Dregen climbing onto his amps and everything just 100mph the group did make great use of the green lights at the front of the stage and dry ice bellowing out from under their step up platforms to which the group knew where to stand and at what moment, making the effect worthwhile.</p>
    <p>On tonight’s performance this band could easily have been the headliners and no one would have gone home disappointed these lads from Sweden just get better and better. So It’s down to one of the most loved British rock bands of the last 30 years to take the stage, and what a turn out and reception they receive from the packed masses. Straight into “EVERLONE” and the place is jumping with Ritch Battersby solid drumming keeping the other 3 band members in check while the place erupts.</p>
    <p>From my vantage point on the front row of the balcony I was directly above where the instant mass of swirling bodies were forming the first of many mosh pits but all done with care and attention to those around them. “DIAGNOSES” with its AC/DC style riff, and lyrics relating to the much needed attention to mental illness is both poignant and a monster of a track with CJ looking fancy in his hat all over the stage not keeping still for a minute exchanging riffs with Ginger before its straight into mass sing along of “VANILLA RADIO” and first real pop / rock moment of the evening.</p>
    <p>Ginger obviously aware of the mental crowd in front of him says something that I have never heard in my entire life and never expected to. So I quote “ Brexit is done so all laws are out the window so everyone over the barrier and on stage if you want !!” before it’s a manic 3 minutes of “CAFFEINE BOMB” with neither a note or a vocal mistake to be heard, how that track can be played is beyond me and with bodies flying into the photo pit then running round for another go it was just good fun to witness.</p>
    <p>The great thing was when the people were helped by security over the barrier not one person tried to get on stage, they just respected that was where the group were working hard. Through the set we get a sprinkling of new material like “LET EM GO” “DISLOCATED” “MY KIND OF MOVIE” and the previous mentioned “DIAGNOSES” which all go down like long lost classics. Talking of classic how can you possibly pick a set list from someone as prolific as Ginger Wildheart? Not everyone will be happy, but with appearances of “TV TAN” and “SICK OF DRUGS” they couldn’t go wrong.</p>
    <p>Special mention to Danny McCormack who plays a tight set with his low-slung bass and it’s safe to say that its lovely to see one of the nicest men in music back on stage where he is suppose to be. As for Ginger well he likes to throw in a surprise or two and he made my evening by including “THE REVOLUTION WILL BE TELEVISED” from the self-titled 2007 white album.</p>
    <p>With its snare drum intro and doubled up guitars and a chorus I don’t think the group have ever bettered it pushed the evening up another notch or two, Of Course no Wildheart’s show would be complete without “I WANNA GO WHERE THE PEOPLE GO” with the noise being louder off stage than on.</p>
    <p>So, with a fond farewell the group quickly return for a two-song encore of “MY BABY IS A HEADFUCK” and a stomping “LOVE YOU TIL I DON’T” with that infamous quick blast of reggae mid-section. Having witnessed THE WILDHEARTS live I felt exhausted! It was loud, it was sweaty, it was carnage and it was brilliantly executed from one of the most talented artists these shores have produced for many a year.</p>
    <p>In fact with the added bonus of CKY and BACKYARD BABIES this was a killer evening’s entertainment, although only one month into the year I really can’t see how in the remaining 11 months this show is going to topped. Simply amazing!</p>

    </svg>Live Reviews
    <p>Tonight sees the return of the mighty GWAR to our fair shores! It seems very much to be a theme recently for bands who have been away for a decade to make the leap across the ocean and once again serenade their British and European fans and I am here for it figuratively and, tonight, literally! It’s a slow build tonight as the crowds are filtering in slowly but surely, and the band tasked with the challenge of getting things started are Childrain.</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\childrain\IMG_0764-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>Five young guys from Spain, two of whom are brothers, and right from the offset you can see that bond and how it gives them a real charged energy.</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\childrain\IMG_0761-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>They rip into their opening track with real power and really give it their all. Despite the fact that the crowd have yet to really fill the place out there is a good energy building and they interact and connect well.</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\childrain\IMG_0732-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>Not only do they have the enthusiasm but they have the talent to back it up. Guitarist Iker Bengoa plays some extremely impressive and complex guitar licks and drummer Mikel Gómez takes it all to another level with his energetic and enthusiastic rhythms that really make for a full, heavy sound.</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\childrain\IMG_0687-604x906.jpg"/>
    <p>There is definite movement in the room as they hammer through their set, rich with melodies that intertwine with the metalcore heart of it using a variety of clean and more gritty vocals to show the diversity of their talents.</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\childrain\IMG_0637-604x906.jpg"/>
    <p>I think that it is safe to say they have definitely kicked the night off well and there are definitely some new fans in the room!!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\childrain\IMG_0642-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>The room fills a little more and the next band to take the stage are legends in their own right: the mighty Voivod!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\voivod\IMG_0810-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>Tonight is a great showcase of bands who have real longevity in the genre and in many ways trailblazers when they started out in the mid-eighties, and these guys are a prime example.</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\voivod\IMG_0813-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>To be able to preserve a thriving fan base for all this time is no mean feat, but as they begin to play their eclectic and heavy sound, it’s obvious what the appeal is. This band really keep you on your toes!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\voivod\IMG_0866-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>Clearly having the best time, vocalist Denis Belanger, or ‘Snake’, kept the energy flowing throughout, his band members behind him pulling all the shapes and throwing out some immense riffage and beats.</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\voivod\IMG_0882-604x906.jpg"/>
    <p>The band have embraced many different styles of music across their career and seem now to have concocted what presents itself as a culmination of all of these styles. There’s definite punk attitude in there and it’s got so many elements that your head will spin. but ultimately this works for them and they absolutely smash it!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\voivod\IMG_0893-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>With a whopping 14 albums under their belt they are definitely not short of brilliant material to present tonight and, impressively, they all hold their own. To be able to write music as late as last year that compliments and fits in with music from earlier in their career, especially given their shift across the styles, is a real testament to their talents.</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\voivod\IMG_0897-604x906.jpg"/>
    <p>It’s great to see a band so seasoned and so comfortable in their surroundings that they can just fully enjoy rocking out and bantering with their audience. The now full room is well and truly in metal mode!!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\voivod\IMG_0905-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>Heading towards the pit for tonight’s main event and everyone is wearing full waterproof gear head to toe – I start to worry I will become a prime target for all the ‘goo’ we have been forewarned about on all the posters plastered around the place, in fact the only thing not wrapped in plastic is me!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\GWAR\IMG_1038-604x906.jpg"/>
    <p>The amps are fully wrapped and the barrier is draped, our bags stored safely down the side of the stage – having never experienced this band before, my excitement was building – not a stranger to being doused in fake blood myself (I used to perform on stage my own act called the Bride of Bloodshed), I was more than happy to witness the gorefest – but less certain I wanted to be in direct firing range! Thankfully security came to my rescue with a white disposable poncho – very fetching but also, it transpires, very necessary!!!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\GWAR\IMG_1033-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>Then the moment is upon us and the gargantuan creatures that are Balsac , Beefcake the Mighty, Jizmak Da Gusha and Blothar the Beserker take to the stage, and what a sight they are! Completely dominating the space they now occupy and commanding full attention, these huge monsters take off with opening number The Salaminizer, taking no prisoners as they power away!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\GWAR\IMG_1147-604x906.jpg"/>
    <p>Now they have us all in the palm of their clawed hands, the carnage begins – first to fall victim is a grotesque looking police officer who attempts to shut down the show – not a hope! He is sliced open and jets of blood pummel the front row who are all wearing white t-shirts – creating a human blank canvas for Gwar to go to town on – and that town is hell!!!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\GWAR\IMG_1066-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>Trying to avoid it as I do, I still manage to take a direct jet of blood to the face before, as final humiliation, what’s left of the policeman is impaled on a large pole and carried off by bloodied minions!! Whew! If that’s just the opener, what is to come?!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\GWAR\IMG_1075-2-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>I’ll tell you: the band, newly invigorated by a successful slaughter, roar their way through an impressive set, another example of a band with a meaty back catalogue (no, that’s not a euphemism) to pick from.</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\GWAR\IMG_1043-604x906.jpg"/>
    <p>What follows is a dark and twisted romp through a greatest hits fest(er), punctuated with elaborate theatrics and the bloodiest, goriest spectacle I have ever witnessed. This included a dog puking blood, a pregnant Caitlin Jenner having a c-section resulting in her and her newborn infant drowning the all-too-enthusiastic and willing crowd with yet more gore and Donald trump performing oral sex on GWAR’s leader before also suffering a gruesome death!!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\GWAR\IMG_1095-604x906.jpg"/>
    <p>The dark and twisted is dialled up to 11 and is fuelled by a killer – pun intended – soundtrack of immense proportions!!</p>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\GWAR4-12-2019\GWAR\IMG_1160-680x453.jpg"/>
    <p>As the crowd disperse, far from looking shocked and horrified there are blood spattered smiles all around – an absolute triumph of a show and one I’ll not soon forget!!</p>

    <h2>Airbourne, Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown + Celar Door Moon Crow, 0<sup>2</sup> Academy, Sheffield on 28<sup>th</sup> November 2019</h2>
    <img src="..\images\reviews\live\Airbourne 22-11-2019\airbourne\F84A0E89-8BDB-48AC-A2B1-590940FC6589.jpeg" style="max-width:100%"/>
    <p>A cool November evening in Sheffield see’s the might Airbourne play at the 02 Sheffield as part of their current UK tour. The line-up has an impressive three bands on, so some serious bang for your coin tonight.</p>
    <p style="text-decoration:underline">Cellar Door Moon Crow</p>
    <p>Duo brothers Phil & Tom Goodwin are up first and set the bar high. This duo is on it from the first song and don’t let up for the entire set.</p>
    <p>Some may say that duo’s, especially on stage, lack a certain dynamic though CDMC certainly dispel that myth. From twin vocal rapping to power shredding guitar, thunderous drumming topped with occasional sublime keyboard the brothers know their stuff and the crowd fully appreciate their efforts too.</p>
    <p>The brothers are clearly enjoying themselves and this resonates to the crowd. Each and every song concludes to the sound of cheers and substantial applause from the appreciative crowd.</p>
    <p>All too soon the set is over though the brothers leave the stage to more rapturous applause. One duo to keep an eye on.</p>

    <p style="text-decoration:underline">Tyler Bryant & The Shakedown</p>
    <p>Hailing from Nashville, Tennessee this four-piece band have been around for a few years now. Led by the exceptionally talented guitarist and singer Tyler Bryant the band are slick, well-rehearsed and deliver a superb rock sound. </p>
    <p>Tyler is barely still for the entire set, seemingly only able to stand still whilst addressing the crowd of the next song. He is ably supported by his band who are certainly not bereft of quality talent either.</p>
    <p>Tylers talent is clear to see, which he wraps up in a wonderous stage spectacle. From searing riffs to sublime solo’s, Tyler and the Shakedown have the crowd bouncing along with them for their entire set. As with CDMC before them the crowd are fully engaged for the entire ride.</p>
    <p>TB&TS conclude their set and leave the stage to warm applause from the Sheffield crowd, who are fully appreciative of what they have just witnessed.</p>

    <p>If you have not heard of tonight’s headline act then I can only assume that you have only just been introduced to the world of rock, or you have had your head buried in sand for the last several years. Hailing from Melbourne, Austrailia, this five-piece monster of a rock band have played almost everywhere including, probably, almost every major festival there is.</p>
    <p>The house lights dim, the crowd roars and then all hell breaks loose. The band tear into the opening song, Raise The Flag and the combined noise of the band and crowd almost raises the roof.</p>
    <p>Joel, as always, is simply a 110% energy bomb of guitaring, vocals and whipping the crowd into a frenzy. Matt, Justin & Ryan all combine with Joel to provide what is a supersonic rock ‘n’ roll ride of epic proportion. If you don’t hang on you’ll simply fall of and be left behind.</p>
    <p>Chit chat is minimal, for the first few songs, and the crowd is left almost gasping for air with the speed things move at. The band throw in some classic songs along with some from the new album too.</p>
    <p>Add to the music and light spectacle, the “Lemmy Bar” interlude, which leaves you wondering about Austrailian spirit measures and the manually used air raid siren, which Ryan cranked up to an ear splitting level, and a trip into the crowd by Joel, the whole night is a huge success on every front. Those who have seen Airbourne before havebeen thoroughly refreshed to their ways and anyone in for their first time, now knows what to expect.</p>
    <p>The band finish with the epic Runnin’ Wild and the crowd are going wild. Job done the lads leave the stage to roars of appreciation.</p>
